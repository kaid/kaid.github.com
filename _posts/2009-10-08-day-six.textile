Installed moinmoin, and setup a local wiki to gather and sort datas I've collected. Emacs has extensions with wiki features, but while I'm quite a noob to elisp and Emacs platform, I have to take time for that.

Easy_install is great at fetching and installing packages from pypi, but sucks at further package management.
