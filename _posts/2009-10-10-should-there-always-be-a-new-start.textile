*No, nope, nay!*

Always set a new start, means you might've never set out(or just keep going back to your start point continuously) -- like I did. 

Tody, um, I'm going to set, another, yes, new start -- I told I'm a *feeble-willed* guy. This is no good, but this is also necessary. I odered my running wares for this fall and the coming winter. I picked up my schedulebook *again*, and plan to fill it with something *again*. From now on, days are new *again*.
