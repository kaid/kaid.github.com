This is the following post to the beginning one. And today is the *third day*, site is running with some basic functions enabled, and many empty pages -- this is all due to my dilatoriness.

There must be something wrong. Attitude, I mean. I have some *fatal weaknesses* in my character. I'm not *durable*, in many aspects, neither can I *concentrate* myself every now and then. I managed to make better changes, then failed most tries. There is something I haven't root out yet. I have to _stand up straight_, it's a long run.
