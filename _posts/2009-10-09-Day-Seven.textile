Ok the seventh day comes to pass.

I had an interview today, which made me feel really bad, or even far worse. I'm not going to regret my decisions made late last year. I'm going to regret my feeble will. I'm not a man that could always get things done, I delayed, and things delayed.

Not only this time should be a *profound lesson*.
