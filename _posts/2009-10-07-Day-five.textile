Today sitemap.xml, robot.txt were updated, also a favicon uploaded.

My writings looked like a *mess*, they were typed down into fragments, there is no focus of my words, sentences could not concentrate in to themes. From every word I type, every sentence I put down, I find I'm not actually caring about themes. Instead, I'm always worrying about if I am making mistakes, if my sentences were syntactically beautiful. I noticed there is a *weird idea* in my brain--I want to be perfect, in every aspect. This is indeed a morbid imagination, and always makes me much competitiveâ€”I'm always arguing with others, and want to prove how right I am, *I just can't help it*.

Once more, thank god I could still treat myself a bit honest, and this is the *sole cure* for my problem.
